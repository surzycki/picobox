Feature: Running an interactive command

  In order to test interactive command line applications
  As a developer using Cucumber
  I want to use the interactive session steps

  Background:
    Given I use a fixture named "cli-app"

  @wip-jruby-java-1.6
  Scenario: Running ruby interactively
    Given an executable named "bin/cli" with:
    """bash
    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    while res = gets.chomp
      break if res == "quit"
      puts res.reverse
    end
    """
    And a file named "features/interactive.feature" with:
    """cucumber

        When I run `cli` interactively
